This program is just a implementation of Dijkstra algorithm. We 
used STL for simplification of the functions and process.

How the project is structured is
	* 3 header files
		* maptograph.h
		* filereader.h
		* routingfunction.h
	*Main.cpp

The program takes input through inputfile. The output is displayed in console.

Working
=======
	The working of the program is that the user enters the s-starting and t-target
in the userhand.txt. The only limitation is that the program still works for division 
of road, not for any location of the map. 
	When the user enters the s and t in appropriate location. Then the user enters the
1 in console, then it prints the shortest path from s and t in the console using the 
following symbols for directions(^,V,>,<). The symbol appears for each division with 
appropriate directions.
	
	The path that it shows is the shortest path in the map.

Uses
====
	*The map used is a part of CEG map.

	*Finds quickly shortest path

Future Developments
===================
	* Use of GUI is possible

	* Finding path from any location to any other location in the map
